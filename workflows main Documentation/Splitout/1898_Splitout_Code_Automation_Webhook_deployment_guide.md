# Deployment Guide: Amazon keywords

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Setup
- [ ] n8n instance is running and accessible
- [ ] Required credentials are configured
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Network connectivity to external services

### ✅ Workflow Validation
- [ ] Workflow JSON is valid
- [ ] All nodes are properly configured
- [ ] Connections are correctly established
- [ ] Error handling is implemented

### ✅ Security Review
- [ ] No sensitive data in workflow JSON
- [ ] Credentials use secure storage
- [ ] Webhook endpoints are secured
- [ ] Access controls are in place

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Direct Import
1. Copy the workflow JSON
2. In n8n, go to Workflows > Import
3. Paste the JSON content
4. Save and configure credentials

### Method 2: File Upload
1. Save workflow as `.json` file
2. Use n8n import functionality
3. Upload the file
4. Review and activate

### Method 3: API Deployment
```bash
# Example using n8n API
curl -X POST "http://your-n8n-instance/api/v1/workflows" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d @workflow.json
```

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Credential Setup
Configure these credentials in n8n:
- **airtableTokenApi**: [Instructions for setting up airtableTokenApi]

### 2. Environment Variables
Set these environment variables:
- `WEBHOOK_URL`: [Description of what this variable should contain]
- `BASE_URL`: [Description of what this variable should contain]

### 3. Webhook Configuration
Configure webhook endpoints:
- **Path**: `e1df17af-e8b8-4261-ba45-aba7106c65bd`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `https://your-n8n-instance/webhook/e1df17af-e8b8-4261-ba45-aba7106c65bd`


## Testing & Validation

### 1. Test Execution
- Run workflow in test mode
- Verify all nodes execute successfully
- Check data transformations
- Validate output format

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test with real data sources
- Verify external API connections
- Check error handling scenarios
- Monitor performance metrics

### 3. Load Testing
- Test with expected data volume
- Monitor execution time
- Check resource usage
- Verify scalability

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Monitoring Setup
- Enable execution logging
- Set up performance monitoring
- Configure error alerts
- Monitor webhook usage

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular credential rotation
- Update API endpoints if needed
- Monitor for deprecated nodes
- Review and optimize performance

### Backup & Recovery
- Export workflow regularly
- Backup credential configurations
- Document custom configurations
- Test recovery procedures

## Production Considerations

### Security
- Use HTTPS for webhook endpoints
- Implement proper authentication
- Regular security audits
- Monitor access logs

### Performance
- Expected execution time: 30+ seconds
- Monitor resource usage
- Optimize for your data volume
- Consider rate limiting

### Reliability
- Implement retry logic
- Set up monitoring alerts
- Plan for disaster recovery
- Regular health checks
