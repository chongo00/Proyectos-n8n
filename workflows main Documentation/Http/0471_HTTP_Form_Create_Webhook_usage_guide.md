# Usage Guide: Httprequest Workflow

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Configure Credentials**: Set up the following credentials in n8n:
   - stripeApi

2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure these environment variables:
   - `BASE_URL`
   - `API_BASE_URL`

### Deployment Steps

1. **Import Workflow**
   - Copy the workflow JSON into your n8n instance
   - Or import directly from the workflow file

2. **Configure Credentials**
   - Go to Settings > Credentials
   - Add all required credentials as identified above

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Configure in your n8n environment or `.env` file
   - Ensure all variables are properly set

4. **Test Workflow**
   - Run the workflow in test mode
   - Verify all nodes execute successfully
   - Check data flow and transformations

5. **Activate Workflow**
   - Enable the workflow for production use
   - Monitor execution logs for any issues

## Workflow Flow

This workflow consists of 30 nodes with the following execution flow:

1. **Trigger**: Workflow starts with n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger, n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook
2. **Processing**: Data flows through 28 processing nodes

## Configuration Options

### Node Configuration
- Review each node's parameters
- Update any hardcoded values
- Configure retry and timeout settings

### Error Handling
âœ… This workflow includes error handling nodes

### Performance Tuning
- Monitor execution time: 30+ seconds
- Optimize for your expected data volume
- Consider rate limiting for external APIs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Credential Errors**: Verify all credentials are properly configured
2. **Environment Variable Issues**: Check that all required variables are set
3. **Node Execution Failures**: Review node logs for specific error messages
4. **Data Format Issues**: Ensure input data matches expected format

### Debug Mode
- Enable debug mode in n8n settings
- Check execution logs for detailed information
- Use test data to verify workflow behavior

## Best Practices
- Regularly monitor workflow execution
- Set up alerts for failures
- Keep credentials secure and rotate regularly
- Test changes in development environment first
