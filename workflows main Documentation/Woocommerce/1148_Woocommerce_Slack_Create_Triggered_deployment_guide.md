## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Setup
- [ ] n8n instance is running and accessible
- [ ] Required credentials are configured
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Network connectivity to external services

### ✅ Workflow Validation
- [ ] Workflow JSON is valid
- [ ] All nodes are properly configured
- [ ] Connections are correctly established
- [ ] Error handling is implemented

### ✅ Security Review
- [ ] No sensitive data in workflow JSON
- [ ] Credentials use secure storage
- [ ] Webhook endpoints are secured

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Direct Import
1. Copy the workflow JSON
2. In n8n, go to Workflows > Import
3. Paste the JSON content
4. Save and configure credentials

### Method 2: File Upload
1. Save workflow as `.json` file
2. Use n8n import functionality
3. Upload the file
4. Review and activate

### Method 3: API Deployment
```bash
# Example using n8n API
curl -X POST "http://your-n8n-instance/api/v1/workflows" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d @workflow.json
```
